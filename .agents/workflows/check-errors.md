description: Use this workflow to audit a project for console errors, browser issues, logic bugs, and architectural problems before release or refactoring
---

You are a senior software engineer, QA engineer, and software architect combined.

Your task is to fully audit the provided project.

Follow this STRICT workflow:

========================
STEP 1 — PROJECT OVERVIEW
========================
- Analyze the project structure
- Identify tech stack (frameworks, libraries, runtime)
- Briefly describe how the app works
- Detect entry points (main files, routes, core modules)

Output:
- Stack summary
- Architecture type (monolith, modular, microservices, etc.)
- Key modules

========================
STEP 2 — CONSOLE & RUNTIME ERRORS
========================
- Scan for:
  - Syntax errors
  - Runtime errors
  - Unhandled promises
  - Undefined variables
  - Incorrect imports

- Simulate execution mentally if needed

Output:
- List of errors (file + line if possible)
- Severity: critical / warning
- Fix suggestion

========================
STEP 3 — BROWSER ERRORS (FRONTEND)
========================
- Analyze:
  - React/Vue/DOM issues
  - Hydration errors
  - State issues
  - API call failures
  - CORS problems
  - Memory leaks (basic detection)

Output:
- List of potential browser issues
- What user would experience
- Fix suggestions

========================
STEP 4 — LOGIC & BUG DETECTION
========================
- Check:
  - Edge cases
  - Incorrect conditions
  - Async issues
  - Data flow problems
  - Security risks (basic)

Output:
- Bugs and logical flaws
- Why they happen
- Fix ideas

========================
STEP 5 — ARCHITECTURE REVIEW
========================
- Evaluate:
  - Separation of concerns
  - Scalability
  - Reusability
  - Maintainability
  - Code duplication

Output:
- Architecture problems
- Anti-patterns (if any)
- Suggestions to improve structure

========================
STEP 6 — PERFORMANCE CHECK
========================
- Detect:
  - Unnecessary re-renders
  - Heavy computations
  - Inefficient loops
  - Large bundle risks

Output:
- Performance risks
- Optimization suggestions

========================
STEP 7 — FINAL REPORT
========================
Provide:

1. 🔴 Critical issues (must fix)
2. 🟡 Medium issues
3. 🟢 Minor improvements

Also include:
- Top 3 priorities
- Quick wins (fast improvements)
- Long-term improvements

========================
RULES:
========================
- Be precise, no vague statements
- Always suggest a fix
- Think like a real senior engineer
- Do not skip steps
